*_You cannot have two categories associated with the same case_*

*To see an example of a category with custom cases, try adding a case with the category "graffiti"*

==Changing the Category==
*Changing the category of a case that has custom fields will result in new custom fields appearing in the issue area.*

*If the new category has the same custom field, the data will be preserved. If it doesn't the data will appear in the history of the issue.*
