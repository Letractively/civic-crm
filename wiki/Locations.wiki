<div>Much of the time the matter being reported about will be based around a particular place. We are only allowing for locations that are found in GIS's list of master streets and addresses. This allows us to do two things:</div>
<div>
<ol><li>Make sure we have the most up-to-date information about that location (its neighborhood, changes to the address, property owner, etc).</li>
<li>Keep a list of everything that has occurred at that location.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can search and select either:</p>
<ul><li>A specific address </li>
<li>A verified street in our master street database - for issues expanding past one specific location</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Subunits</h2>
The search results will not list subunits unless you ask for a specific subunit. If your intended address is a subunit, include the subunit in the address search box. If a matching subunit is found for that address, it will be included in the search results.<br>
</div>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>ITS is working on a feature where you can select the location on a map. This will allow you to see issues open in a given area, and select particular locations without worrying about the address.</p>
 
<p>We will record this locations using their latitude and longitude).</p>
