#labels tickets,issues
Issues are specific requests from either a constituent or a staff member. They represent one instance of a complaint or issue that needs to be followed up.

Since multiple requests can require the same actions (the same inspections for example), requests can be placed in tickets to make it easier on the assigned staff.

Tickets are used to associate actions performed by staff to the requests that instigated the actions.

Tickets may contain the following information:
  * Issues (requests)
  * Actions
  * A location
  * An assigned staff member
  * A referral to someone outside the organization
  * A date the ticket was opened
  * The person who opened it
  * A status and resolution

Issues may contain the following information:
  * The person reporting the issue
  * The type of issue (request, question, etc)
  * Categories (multiple can be assigned - Trash Violations, Building violations, etc)
  * Any responses to the person reporting the issue

Both tickets and issues contain many comment fields, as well.
