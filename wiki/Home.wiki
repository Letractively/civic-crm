uReport ("civic-crm") is a small scale, standalone, CRM web application with an Open311 (GeoReport v2) endpoint that should meet the needs of smaller municipalities wishing to deploy Open311 and/or a lightweight constituent management tool. Context-switched feeds (XML, JSON, etc) allow it to easily be integrated into existing environments.
